## Project Saving and Loading Functionality

This requirement details the necessity for users to be able to save their work and subsequently load it. This is a fundamental feature for any application that involves user-generated content, as emphasized in `[[../Definition/Vision/Idea.md#layer-1-user-experience--functional-requirements-the-what]]`. The implementation is primarily addressed by the `[[../../Specification/Concepts/data-manager-module.mdmd]]` with data flow described in `[[../../Specification/Concepts/sprunki-data-flow.mdmd]]`.

The system should provide clear mechanisms for both saving and loading projects. The saved data must capture the complete state of the project, ensuring that when a project is loaded, it is restored to the exact condition it was in when saved.

This is a `[[core-system-requirements]]` and is related to `[[project-autosave-requirement]]`.
