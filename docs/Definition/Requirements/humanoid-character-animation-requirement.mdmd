## Requirement Overview

The Open Sprunk Framework shall provide an intuitive humanoid character animation system that leverages the constraint that all "Sprunks" are people to enable sophisticated yet user-friendly animation authoring.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-HCA-001: Modular Body Part System
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Characters shall be composed of distinct, animatable body parts with standardized connection points.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Characters consist of 6 primary body parts: head, body/torso, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg
- Each body part can be drawn/designed independently by users
- Body parts have defined hinge/connection points for realistic articulation
- Additional sub-parts supported: hands, feet for enhanced expressiveness
- All body parts maintain individual transformation properties (position, rotation, scale)

### FR-HCA-002: Intuitive Direct Manipulation Interface
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Users shall animate characters through direct manipulation ("click and drag a doll to make it dance").

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Click and drag any body part to create keyframes at current timeline position
- Real-time visual feedback showing character pose as user manipulates parts
- Automatic inverse kinematics for natural limb movement
- Visual indicators for valid manipulation ranges and constraints
- One-click pose setting from direct character interaction

### FR-HCA-003: Instrument Integration System
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Characters shall support built-in instruments as part of their design for musical performance animation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Characters can have instruments attached to specific body parts (hands, mouth, etc.)
- Instrument attachment points defined during character creation
- Animation system aware of instrument constraints (e.g., hands positioned for piano playing)
- Pre-defined instrument templates: trumpet, piano/keyboard, guitar, drums
- Custom instrument attachment support for user creativity

### FR-HCA-004: Educational Animation Assistance
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** The system shall provide educational guidance for creating natural, expressive animations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Real-time physics simulation for natural movement preview
- Animation "suggestions" based on musical rhythm and tempo
- Visual guides showing natural human movement ranges
- Pre-defined pose libraries: dancing positions, instrument-playing poses, idle animations
- Smart interpolation that maintains realistic human proportions

### FR-HCA-005: Audio-Animation Synchronization
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Animations shall synchronize seamlessly with user-created music.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Beat-aware keyframe placement (snap to musical beats)
- Automatic rhythm-based animation suggestions
- Visual metronome integration in animation timeline
- Music-driven pose transitions (e.g., dance moves timed to beats)
- Real-time preview of synchronized audio-visual performance

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-HCA-001: Performance
- Support for 60fps animation preview with up to 100 keyframes per body part
- Real-time manipulation response time < 16ms for smooth interaction
- Memory usage < 50MB for complex character with full animation set

### NFR-HCA-002: Usability
- New users can create basic walking animation within 5 minutes
- Direct manipulation interface requires no tutorial for basic poses
- Animation principles discoverable through interface affordances

### NFR-HCA-003: Extensibility
- Body part system supports future expansion (wings, tails, additional limbs)
- Animation data format supports custom properties and metadata
- Plugin architecture for custom animation behaviors

## Technical Considerations

### Side-View Sprite Support Decision
**Question:** Should characters support distinct side-view sprites for profile animations?

**Recommendation:** Start with front-facing only, add side-view as Phase 2 enhancement
- **Pros:** Richer storytelling, more natural character interaction
- **Cons:** Doubles art creation effort, complicates animation blending
- **Approach:** Design data schema to support multiple viewpoints but implement front-view first

### Hinge Point Standardization
**Approach:** Define standardized connection points while preserving creative freedom
- Standard hinge locations: neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles
- Visual guides during character creation showing optimal hinge placement
- Flexible system allowing artists to adjust hinge points for stylistic choices
- Automatic hinge detection with manual override capability

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1:** Core body part system with direct manipulation
2. **Phase 2:** Instrument integration and pose libraries  
3. **Phase 3:** Advanced features (side-view, IK, physics simulation)

## Success Metrics
- Users create first successful character animation within 10 minutes
- 90% of created animations exhibit natural, appealing movement
- Audio-animation synchronization accuracy within 50ms of intended timing
- User satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0 for animation creation experience
