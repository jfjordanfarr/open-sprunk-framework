## Undo/Redo Functionality

This requirement defines the system's capability to reverse or reapply user actions. This is essential for creative applications where users need to experiment and iterate. This functionality contributes to the user experience goals in `[[../Definition/Vision/Idea.md#layer-1-user-experience--functional-requirements-the-what]]` and is implemented within the `[[../../Specification/Concepts/app-core-module.mdmd]]`.

The undo/redo system should operate across all creative modules (character editor, music editor, animation editor) and provide a clear indication of the action history.
