## Responsive Layout Design Requirement

The Open Sprunk Framework shall provide a responsive layout system that adapts seamlessly across device form factors while maintaining full creative functionality on tablets, desktops, and large mobile devices.

### Core Requirements

**Multi-Device Support:**
- Primary target: Desktop computers (1920x1080 and above)
- Secondary target: Tablet devices in landscape orientation (1024x768 and above) 
- Tertiary target: Large mobile devices in landscape orientation (768x432 and above)
- Portrait mobile layouts may provide limited functionality but must remain navigable

**Layout Adaptation:**
- UI panels shall reflow and resize appropriately for different viewport dimensions
- Critical creative tools (character editor, stage interface) shall remain fully functional on tablet-sized screens
- Navigation and core functionality shall be accessible across all supported device sizes

**Touch Interface Optimization:**
- Interactive elements shall meet minimum touch target size requirements (44px minimum)
- Drawing interfaces shall support both mouse and touch input with appropriate scaling
- Gesture support for common creative actions (pan, zoom, select) on touch devices

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Viewport Responsiveness**: Interface adapts smoothly across supported screen sizes without horizontal scrolling
2. **Feature Parity**: Core creative functionality (character creation, stage layout) works on tablet devices
3. **Touch Optimization**: All interactive elements are easily accessible with finger input
4. **Performance**: Layout transitions are smooth and do not impact creative workflow
5. **Consistency**: Visual design and interaction patterns remain consistent across device sizes

### Implementation Constraints

- Responsive behavior must not compromise creative precision on any supported device
- Layout changes must preserve user work and application state during viewport transitions
- Mobile-specific layouts should gracefully degrade complex features rather than breaking them
- Touch interactions must co-exist with mouse/keyboard interactions without conflicts

### Technical Specifications

- CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts for responsive panel systems
- CSS media queries for breakpoint-based layout adjustments
- JavaScript viewport detection for dynamic layout modifications
- Touch event handling alongside traditional mouse/keyboard input

This requirement ensures that Open Sprunk Framework provides an excellent creative experience across the full spectrum of devices used for digital content creation.
