## Requirement Statement

The Open Sprunk Framework **MUST** provide a unified timeline experience where users can compose loops of music and animations in a shared temporal interface. This enables players to "deal in time" as a unified creative medium rather than managing separate timing systems.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Shared Temporal Reference
- **MUST** provide a common time base for both music and animation editing
- **MUST** use consistent time units (beats, measures, seconds) across music and animation systems
- **MUST** synchronize playback cursors and timeline scrubbing between music and animation views

### 2. Unified Timeline Interface
- **MUST** provide a timeline view that shows both music tracks and animation keyframes on the same temporal axis
- **SHOULD** allow users to see how music notes align with animation keyframes visually
- **MUST** support simultaneous editing of music and animation elements within the shared timeline
- **SHOULD** provide tempo grid snapping that works for both music and animation placement

### 3. Integrated Playback Control
- **MUST** provide unified play/pause/stop controls that affect both music and animation playback
- **MUST** maintain synchronization during playback with sub-frame precision
- **MUST** support looped playback where both music and animation seamlessly cycle together
- **SHOULD** provide scrubbing functionality that previews both audio and animation simultaneously

### 4. Temporal Coordination
- **MUST** allow tempo changes that automatically adjust animation timing proportionally
- **MUST** support measure-based and beat-based alignment for animation keyframes
- **SHOULD** provide automatic quantization options for both music notes and animation keyframes
- **MUST** maintain temporal relationships when importing/exporting projects

### 5. Cross-Domain Timing Features
- **SHOULD** provide beat markers that are visible in both music and animation views
- **MUST** support copying/pasting temporal selections across music and animation domains
- **SHOULD** allow musical patterns (like rhythm) to be applied to animation timing
- **SHOULD** provide timeline zoom that maintains consistency across music and animation views

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Workflow
1. User creates a music loop with specific tempo and structure
2. User adds animation keyframes that align with musical beats/measures
3. User can see both music notes and animation keyframes on the same timeline
4. User can adjust timing of either music or animation while maintaining their relationship
5. User can play back the unified creation and see/hear synchronized result

### Interface Design Principles
- **Timeline Primacy**: The timeline view should be the central organizing principle for temporal editing
- **Visual Alignment**: Users should be able to visually verify that music and animation events align properly
- **Unified Controls**: Transport controls (play, pause, scrub) should affect both domains simultaneously
- **Temporal Feedback**: Real-time preview should show both visual animation and audio playback

## Technical Constraints

### Synchronization Precision
- **MUST** maintain synchronization within 10ms tolerance during playback
- **MUST** support variable tempo without breaking sync
- **SHOULD** handle tempo changes smoothly without audible artifacts

### Performance Requirements
- **MUST** support real-time preview of combined music and animation
- **SHOULD** maintain 60fps animation rendering while playing audio
- **MUST** support timeline scrubbing without performance degradation

## Integration Points

This requirement interfaces with:
- `[[../Implementations/animation/timeline-class.mdmd]]` - Must be enhanced to support music timing
- `[[../Implementations/music/audio-engine-class.mdmd]]` - Must provide timing synchronization APIs
- `[[../Implementations/stage/performance-stage-class.mdmd]]` - Must render synchronized result
- `[[../../Specification/Concepts/music-editor-module.mdmd]]` - Must share timing with animation module
- `[[../../Specification/Concepts/animation-editor-module.mdmd]]` - Must share timing with music module

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Unified Timeline Display**: User can see music tracks and animation keyframes on the same temporal grid
2. **Synchronized Playback**: Play button starts both music and animation simultaneously with perfect sync
3. **Cross-Domain Editing**: Changes to tempo affect both music playback speed and animation timing
4. **Timeline Scrubbing**: Dragging timeline position updates both audio position and animation frame
5. **Visual Alignment**: Beat markers are visible in both music piano roll and animation keyframe views
6. **Temporal Copy/Paste**: User can select a time range and operations affect both music and animation content

## Rationale

This requirement addresses the core creative vision of the Open Sprunk Framework where users compose temporal experiences rather than separate music and animation assets. By providing unified temporal editing, the framework enables more intuitive and creative workflows where users can think in terms of "moments in time" that combine sound and motion.

The unified timeline approach is essential for creating the type of synchronized, rhythmic character performances that define the Sprunki experience, where animations are not just "added to" music but are composed together as integrated temporal compositions.
