## HTML5 Export Functionality

This requirement specifies the system's capability to export user-created projects into a standard HTML5 format. This is a critical feature, as outlined in the `[[../Definition/Vision/OriginatingPrompt.md]]` and aligns with the functional goals in `[[../Definition/Vision/Idea.md#layer-1-user-experience--functional-requirements-the-what]]`. The data flow supporting this export functionality is described in `[[../../Specification/Concepts/sprunki-data-flow.mdmd]]`.

The export process should bundle all necessary components—HTML structure, JavaScript logic, CSS styling, and any media assets—into a package that can be easily deployed or shared. The exported application must be a faithful representation of the project as it appears and functions within the Open Sprunk Framework editor.

This functionality is part of the `[[core-system-requirements]]`.
