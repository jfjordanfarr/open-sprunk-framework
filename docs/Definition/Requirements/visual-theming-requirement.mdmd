## Visual Theming System Requirement

The Open Sprunk Framework shall implement a comprehensive visual theming system that ensures consistent, cohesive visual design across all interface elements and supports customizable visual experiences.

### Core Requirements

**Theme Foundation:**
- Establish a design token system with consistent color palettes, typography scales, and spacing units
- Provide CSS custom properties (variables) for all themeable visual elements
- Support both light and dark theme variants for different user preferences and environments

**Visual Consistency:**
- All UI components shall derive styling from the centralized theme system
- Visual feedback patterns (hover states, focus indicators, selection highlighting) shall be consistent across all interactive elements
- Game-specific visual elements shall maintain thematic coherence with the creative tool interface

**Customization Support:**
- Users shall be able to modify core theme parameters (accent colors, contrast levels) 
- Theme modifications shall persist across user sessions
- Custom themes shall not break functional requirements or accessibility standards

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Centralized Theme System**: All visual styling derives from a single theme definition source
2. **Cross-Component Consistency**: Interactive elements have consistent visual behavior patterns
3. **Theme Switching**: Users can toggle between predefined theme variants
4. **Persistence**: Theme preferences are maintained across browser sessions
5. **Performance**: Theme application does not impact application load time or runtime performance

### Implementation Constraints

- Theme system must integrate with existing CSS architecture
- Visual changes must not affect functional behavior of UI components
- Theme customizations must be compatible with accessibility requirements
- Design tokens must be compatible with CSS preprocessors and build systems

This requirement establishes the visual foundation that enables a professional, cohesive user experience across the entire Open Sprunk Framework interface.
