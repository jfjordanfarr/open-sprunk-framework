## Autosave Functionality

This requirement defines the system's capability to automatically save user work at regular intervals to prevent data loss. This feature is particularly important for creative applications where users might spend considerable time on their projects. The implementation is described in the `[[../../Specification/Concepts/data-manager-module.mdmd]]` and coordinated by the `[[../../Specification/Concepts/app-core-module.mdmd]]`.
