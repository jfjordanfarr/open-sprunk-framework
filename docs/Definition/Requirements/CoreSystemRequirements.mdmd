This document outlines the fundamental requirements that the Open Sprunk Framework must meet. These are derived from the project's foundational ideas in `[[../Definition/Vision/Idea.md]]` and the `[[../Definition/Vision/OriginatingPrompt.md]]`. The overall fulfillment of these requirements is envisioned in the `[[../../Specification/Concepts/sprunki-game-project.mdmd]]` and supported by the `[[../../Specification/Concepts/sprunki-core-architecture.mdmd]]`.

## Key Requirements

The system **MUST** adhere to the following:

1.  **Client-Side Operation:** The core application logic **MUST** run entirely in the user's web browser. (see `[[client-side-architecture-requirement]]`)
    *   *Rationale:* Ensures accessibility, reduces server load, and aligns with modern web application trends. Derived from `[[../Definition/Vision/Idea.md#core-tenets]]`.
2.  **Project Saving & Loading:** Users **MUST** be able to save their creative projects and load them back into the application. (see `[[project-saving-requirement]]`)
    *   *Rationale:* Essential for any creative tool.
3.  **Autosave Functionality:** The system **SHOULD** implement an autosave feature to prevent data loss. (see `[[project-autosave-requirement]]`)
    *   *Rationale:* Enhances user experience and data integrity.
4.  **HTML5 Export:** Users **MUST** be able to export their projects as runnable HTML5 applications/experiences. (see `[[html5-export-requirement]]`)
    *   *Rationale:* Key deliverable and distribution format. This is a primary goal mentioned in `[[../Definition/Vision/OriginatingPrompt.md]]`.
5.  **Undo/Redo Functionality:** The system **MUST** provide robust undo and redo capabilities for most user actions. (see `[[undo-redo-requirement]]`)
    *   *Rationale:* Standard feature for creative applications, allowing for error correction and experimentation.
6.  **Unified Timeline Experience:** The system **MUST** provide a unified temporal interface where music and animation editing share the same timeline, enabling users to compose loops of synchronized content. (see `[[unified-timeline-requirement]]`)
    *   *Rationale:* Core to the Sprunki experience where users "deal in time" as a unified creative medium, composing moments that combine sound and motion rather than managing separate timing systems.

These requirements are foundational and will be elaborated upon in their respective detailed requirement documents and further refined in architectural and unit specifications.
