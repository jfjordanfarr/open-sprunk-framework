## Application Performance Standards Requirement

The Open Sprunk Framework shall maintain high performance standards that enable smooth, responsive creative workflows across all supported devices and usage scenarios.

### Core Requirements

**Load Performance:**
- Initial application load shall complete within 3 seconds on desktop with high-speed internet
- Progressive loading shall make basic functionality available within 1.5 seconds
- Asset loading (sounds, graphics, fonts) shall not block core interface functionality
- Application shall function offline for previously loaded creative projects

**Runtime Performance:**
- Creative interactions (drawing, character manipulation, stage updates) shall maintain 60fps
- Audio playback and synchronization shall maintain sub-20ms latency
- Memory usage shall remain stable during extended creative sessions (>30 minutes)
- Large project files (>50 characters, >5 minutes of audio) shall load within 10 seconds

**Rendering Performance:**
- Canvas drawing operations shall provide immediate visual feedback (<16ms response)
- Stage visualization shall smoothly handle 8+ characters with animations
- UI updates shall not interfere with audio/visual performance during playback
- Viewport changes and responsive layout adjustments shall complete within 100ms

**Resource Optimization:**
- JavaScript bundle size shall not exceed 500KB (compressed)
- CSS payload shall not exceed 100KB (compressed)  
- Image assets shall use modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
- Audio assets shall use efficient compression without noticeable quality loss

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Load Speed**: Application becomes usable within target timeframes on reference hardware
2. **Interaction Responsiveness**: Creative actions provide immediate visual/audio feedback
3. **Stability**: No memory leaks or performance degradation during typical creative sessions
4. **Scalability**: Performance remains acceptable with complex projects and multiple characters
5. **Efficiency**: Resource usage stays within mobile device capabilities on supported targets

### Implementation Constraints

- Performance optimizations must not compromise creative functionality or precision
- Efficiency improvements should prioritize perceived performance over absolute metrics
- Browser compatibility requirements may limit optimization techniques available
- Real-time audio/visual synchronization takes priority over other performance metrics

### Technical Specifications

- Lazy loading for non-essential interface components and creative assets
- Efficient canvas rendering with minimal DOM manipulation during drawing operations
- Audio context management with proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks
- CSS optimization with critical path prioritization and deferred non-essential styling
- JavaScript optimization with code splitting and efficient event handling

### Performance Monitoring

- Core Web Vitals tracking for load performance measurement
- Custom metrics for creative workflow responsiveness
- Memory usage monitoring during extended sessions
- Audio latency measurement and optimization

This requirement ensures that Open Sprunk Framework provides a professional-grade creative experience that remains responsive and efficient across all supported usage patterns.
