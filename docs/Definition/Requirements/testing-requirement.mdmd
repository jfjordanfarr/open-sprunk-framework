# Testing Infrastructure Requirement

The Open Sprunk Framework shall include comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and enable confident development by both human developers and AI assistants.

## Core Requirements

**Browser-Based Testing:**
- Testing framework shall execute directly in browser without Node.js dependencies
- Tests shall validate all critical user interactions and workflows
- Testing infrastructure shall be automatically available in development mode
- Test results shall be presented in clear, visual format with copy/export capabilities

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
- Core functionality tests shall validate EventBus, StateManager, and AppCore operations
- Integration tests shall validate inter-module communication and data flow
- UI interaction tests shall validate character creation, stage manipulation, and navigation
- Performance tests shall ensure responsive behavior under various load conditions

**Developer Experience:**
- Tests shall execute quickly (< 5 seconds for full suite)
- Failed tests shall provide clear error messages and debugging context
- Test framework shall include assertion helpers for common patterns
- Testing utilities shall integrate with existing ConsoleLogger for consistent output

**AI Assistant Support:**
- Testing framework shall provide context validation helpers
- Path validation utilities shall prevent common file path errors
- Type definitions shall enable better IntelliSense for LLM development assistance
- Development mode shall auto-initialize all testing and validation utilities

This requirement supports the [[../Vision/engine-portable-development-vision]] by ensuring developer tools are comprehensive yet hidden from end users until needed.

## Quality Standards

**Reliability:**
- Test suite shall achieve >90% pass rate under normal conditions
- Tests shall be deterministic and not dependent on timing or external factors
- Testing framework shall handle async operations and DOM manipulation correctly

**Maintainability:**
- Test structure shall mirror application architecture for easy navigation
- Tests shall be self-documenting with clear descriptions and expected outcomes
- Testing utilities shall be modular and reusable across different test scenarios

## Integration Requirements

This requirement supports the [[client-side-architecture-requirement]] by ensuring quality within the browser-only constraint, enhances [[performance-requirement]] through validation of response times, and underpins [[core-system-requirements]] by providing confidence in system reliability.
