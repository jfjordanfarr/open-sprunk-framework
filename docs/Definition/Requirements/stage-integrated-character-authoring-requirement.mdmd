## Problem Statement

Users need to author characters with immediate visual feedback in the context where they will be performed. Creating characters in a separate editor lacks the spatial awareness necessary for accurate scale, positioning, and visual composition with backgrounds and other elements.

## Background

Traditional character editors operate in isolation from the performance context, leading to:

- **Scale Mismatches**: Characters appear different sizes when moved from editor to stage
- **Positioning Issues**: Lack of stage context makes it difficult to plan character placement
- **Background Disconnect**: Cannot see how character relates to stage backgrounds during creation
- **Iterative Inefficiency**: Constant switching between editor and stage for visual validation

This requirement addresses the fundamental UX insight that character authoring should happen **in the stage** or a stage-identical view for optimal creative workflow.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Integration Requirements

1. **Stage-Contextual Drawing**
   - Character drawing tools must operate directly on or overlay the performance stage
   - All drawing operations must respect stage coordinate system and dimensions
   - Background elements must remain visible during character creation

2. **Mode-Based Interaction**
   - Performance Stage must support distinct "edit" and "preview" modes
   - Edit mode enables character creation and modification tools
   - Preview mode provides standard performance playback capabilities
   - Mode switching must be seamless with preserved state

3. **Real-Time Visual Feedback**
   - Character changes must be immediately visible in final performance context
   - Scale and positioning must be accurate to final rendering
   - Background and environmental elements must provide visual context

4. **Drawing Tool Integration**
   - Vector drawing tools (Fabric.js) must integrate with stage canvas
   - Drawing coordinates must map accurately to stage coordinates
   - Character artwork must maintain fidelity across edit/preview modes

### User Experience Requirements

1. **Immediate Context Awareness**
   - Users must see characters in final scale and position during creation
   - Background phases must be visible during character authoring
   - Stage dimensions must constrain and guide character design

2. **Workflow Efficiency**
   - No context switching required between character creation and stage preview
   - Character edits must have immediate visual impact on performance
   - Multi-character coordination must be possible during authoring

3. **Creative Control**
   - Full vector graphics capabilities within stage context
   - Precise positioning and scaling tools
   - Layer management for complex character designs

## Implementation Constraints

- Must maintain existing Performance Stage functionality
- Character editor tools must not interfere with stage performance
- Drawing operations must not impact stage rendering performance
- Must support both touch and mouse input for drawing

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can draw characters directly on the performance stage
2. Character scale and positioning are immediately accurate to final performance
3. Background context is maintained throughout character creation process
4. Seamless mode switching between editing and performance
5. No loss of existing stage functionality
6. Performance maintains 60fps during character editing operations

- `[[client-side-architecture-requirement.mdmd]]` - Client-side implementation constraints
- `[[undo-redo-requirement.mdmd]]` - Edit operation history in stage context
- `[[project-saving-requirement.mdmd]]` - Persistence of stage-authored characters

## Technical Dependencies

- Fabric.js vector graphics engine
- Event system for mode management
- State management for edit/preview coordination
