## Web Accessibility Standards Requirement

The Open Sprunk Framework shall implement comprehensive web accessibility features to ensure the creative tool is usable by individuals with diverse abilities and assistive technology needs.

### Core Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- All interface elements shall meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards
- Color contrast ratios shall meet or exceed 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- Interactive elements shall provide clear focus indicators and keyboard navigation support

**Keyboard Accessibility:**
- All creative functions shall be accessible via keyboard navigation
- Tab order shall follow logical interface flow and creative workflow patterns
- Keyboard shortcuts shall be provided for frequently used creative actions
- No functionality shall be exclusively mouse/touch dependent

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA labels for custom UI components
- Creative canvas elements shall provide text alternatives describing current state
- Dynamic content updates shall be announced appropriately to assistive technology
- Complex visual layouts shall include text-based navigation alternatives

**Motor Accessibility:**
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px) for all interactive elements
- Alternative input methods for precise drawing and selection tasks
- Configurable interaction timeouts and gesture sensitivity
- Sticky drag operations to accommodate limited motor control

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **WCAG Compliance**: Automated accessibility testing shows AA compliance across all interface areas
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete creative workflow can be accomplished using only keyboard input
3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: All interface elements are properly announced and navigable with common screen readers
4. **Color Independence**: All visual information has non-color alternatives (icons, text, patterns)
5. **Motor Accommodation**: Creative tools remain functional with limited precision input devices

### Implementation Constraints

- Accessibility features must not compromise visual design or creative functionality
- Alternative input methods must maintain creative precision where technically feasible
- Screen reader support should focus on interface navigation rather than detailed canvas description
- Accessibility enhancements should leverage browser capabilities rather than requiring specialized plugins

### Technical Specifications

- Semantic HTML5 structure with proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels and descriptions for custom interface components
- CSS focus management with visible focus indicators
- JavaScript keyboard event handling for creative tool operations
- Alternative text and descriptions for visual creative content

This requirement ensures that Open Sprunk Framework can serve the broadest possible community of creative users while maintaining its sophisticated creative capabilities.
