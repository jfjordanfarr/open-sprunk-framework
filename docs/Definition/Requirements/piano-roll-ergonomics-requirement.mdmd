## Description

The piano roll interface shall provide modern DAW-style ergonomics with educational features specifically designed to assist early musicians in learning music theory and composition.

## Functional Requirements

### Key Highlighting System
- **FR-PRE-001**: The piano roll SHALL highlight notes based on musical key and scale selection
- **FR-PRE-002**: The system SHALL support major, minor, modal (dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, locrian), blues, and pentatonic scales
- **FR-PRE-003**: Notes SHALL be visually categorized as:
  - Root notes (highest priority highlighting)
  - Chord tones (medium priority highlighting)  
  - Passing tones (in-scale, low priority highlighting)
  - Out-of-scale notes (minimal/neutral highlighting)
- **FR-PRE-004**: The key selector SHALL provide real-time scale note display (e.g., "C - D - E - F - G - A - B")

### Educational Features
- **FR-PRE-005**: Hovering over cells SHALL display note information including:
  - Note name and octave
  - Scale degree (1-7)
  - Chord tone status
  - In-scale/out-of-scale indication
- **FR-PRE-006**: The system SHALL provide scale degree visual indicators (1, 3, 5 emphasized for triads)
- **FR-PRE-007**: The interface SHALL support preset key shortcuts for common keys (C Major, A Minor, etc.)

### Ghost Notes Support
- **FR-PRE-008**: The piano roll SHALL support displaying semi-transparent "ghost notes" from other tracks
- **FR-PRE-009**: Ghost notes SHALL be visually distinct from active track notes (30% opacity)
- **FR-PRE-010**: Users SHALL be able to toggle ghost note visibility per track
- **FR-PRE-011**: Ghost notes SHALL NOT interfere with note editing on the active track

### Visual Design Requirements
- **FR-PRE-012**: Black key rows SHALL be visually distinguished from white key rows
- **FR-PRE-013**: Beat boundaries SHALL be emphasized with stronger grid lines
- **FR-PRE-014**: The interface SHALL maintain performance with highlighting for grids up to 88 keys Ã— 64 steps
- **FR-PRE-015**: Color coding SHALL be accessible (colorblind-friendly palette)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Educational Value**: A novice musician can identify which notes belong to a selected key within 30 seconds of using the interface
2. **Performance**: Key highlighting updates SHALL complete within 100ms of key selection change
3. **Usability**: The interface SHALL remain intuitive with highlighting disabled (graceful degradation)
4. **Accessibility**: All highlighting information SHALL be available via hover tooltips
5. **Integration**: The key selector SHALL seamlessly integrate with the existing piano roll layout

## Technical Constraints

- Implementation SHALL use CSS classes for highlighting (not inline styles)
- Music theory calculations SHALL be cached for performance
- The system SHALL support future multi-track architecture
- Ghost notes infrastructure SHALL be designed for extensibility

## Educational Impact Goals

- **Music Theory Learning**: Visual reinforcement of scale patterns and chord construction
- **Composition Assistance**: Harmonic context while writing melodies
- **Confidence Building**: Clear visual feedback reduces trial-and-error composition
- **Professional Workflow**: Introduces DAW-standard features in an educational context

## Priority Justification

This requirement is HIGH priority because:
- It directly supports the educational mission for early musicians
- It provides immediate user value without complex backend dependencies
- It establishes the foundation for advanced features (ghost notes, multi-track)
- It differentiates the framework from basic MIDI editors
