## Overview

The **Phase System** is the core feature that enables characters and backgrounds to have multiple distinct states, each combining appearance, music, and animation. This system allows for rich, dynamic performances where characters can transform and evolve throughout a musical experience.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-PS-001: Multi-Modal Phase Definition
Each character phase **MUST** consist of three synchronized components:
- **Appearance**: Visual representation (sprites, textures, colors)
- **Music Loop**: Associated audio content (samples, patterns, effects)
- **Animation**: Movement patterns and behaviors

### FR-PS-002: Phase Management
The system **MUST** support:
- Creating new phases for existing characters
- Duplicating phases as starting points for variations
- Deleting phases with dependency validation
- Reordering phase lists with preserved references

### FR-PS-003: Phase Authoring Workflow
Users **MUST** be able to create phases through multiple workflows:
- **Appearance-First**: Start with visual design, then add music and animation
- **Music-First**: Start with audio loop, then create matching visuals and movement
- **Animation-First**: Start with movement pattern, then add appearance and audio
- **Template-Based**: Use predefined phase templates for rapid creation

### FR-PS-004: Phase Transitions
The system **MUST** support smooth transitions between phases:
- **Instant Switching**: Immediate phase change on trigger
- **Crossfade Transitions**: Gradual visual and audio blending
- **Beat-Synchronized**: Phase changes aligned to musical timing
- **Animated Transitions**: Custom transition animations between phases

### FR-PS-005: Phase Coordination
The system **MUST** support multiple phase coordination modes:
- **Independent**: Each character controls its own phase changes
- **Synchronized**: All characters change phases together
- **Layered**: Characters have primary phases with overlay variations
- **Conditional**: Phase changes based on other characters' states

### FR-PS-006: Background Phase System
Backgrounds **MUST** participate in the phase system:
- Background phases coordinate with character phases
- Background elements can have independent phase timing
- Background phase changes enhance overall visual narrative

### FR-PS-007: Phase Triggers
Phase changes **MUST** be triggered by:
- **User Interaction**: Click, touch, or keyboard input
- **Musical Events**: Beat boundaries, measure changes, audio cues
- **Timeline Events**: Scheduled phase changes during performance
- **Conditional Logic**: State-based automatic phase switching

### FR-PS-008: Phase Data Persistence
The system **MUST** maintain phase integrity:
- All phase components saved atomically in project files
- Phase references preserved across save/load cycles
- Phase metadata (creation date, author, description) tracked
- Version history for phase modifications

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-PS-001: Performance
- Phase transitions **MUST** complete within 100ms for instant switching
- Crossfade transitions **MUST** maintain 60fps during blending
- Memory usage **MUST** scale linearly with number of active phases

### NFR-PS-002: Scalability
- Characters **MUST** support minimum 8 phases each
- Projects **MUST** support minimum 16 characters with full phase systems
- Background elements **MUST** support minimum 4 phases each

### NFR-PS-003: Usability
- Phase authoring workflow **MUST** be intuitive for non-technical users
- Phase selection UI **MUST** provide visual previews
- Phase transitions **MUST** provide clear visual feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Phase Creation**: User can create a new phase for any character through any of the three authoring workflows (appearance-first, music-first, animation-first)

2. **Phase Switching**: User can trigger phase changes during performance with immediate visual and audio feedback

3. **Phase Coordination**: User can configure whether characters change phases independently or in coordination with others

4. **Background Integration**: Background elements respond to character phase changes according to configured coordination rules

5. **Data Persistence**: All phases save correctly and restore with full fidelity across application restarts

6. **Performance Validation**: Phase transitions maintain smooth 60fps performance even with maximum phase complexity

## Dependencies

- Requires enhanced character data schema with phase support
- Requires animation system with phase-aware keyframing
- Requires audio engine with phase-synchronized playback
- Requires editor UI components for phase management
- Requires performance stage with phase coordination logic

## Notes

The Phase System represents the core creative paradigm of Open Sprunk Framework. Its implementation affects every major system component and establishes the foundation for rich, dynamic musical performances.
