brief: "Subsystem for vector graphics manipulation, likely using Fabric.js."
see-also: ["[[character-editor-module]]", "[[drawing-canvas-class]]"]

The Vector Graphics System, primarily utilized by the [[character-editor-module]], provides functionalities for:

- **Shape Creation**: Drawing paths, polygons, circles, etc.
- **Object Manipulation**: Moving, scaling, rotating, grouping vector objects.
- **Styling**: Applying fills, strokes, gradients, and effects.
- **Serialization**: Saving and loading vector scenes (e.g., to/from SVG or custom JSON).

This will be heavily reliant on the chosen library (Fabric.js) and exposed via components like [[drawing-canvas-class]].
