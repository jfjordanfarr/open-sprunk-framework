# Accessibility Architecture

This composition defines the accessibility architecture that ensures the Open Sprunk Framework meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards and provides an inclusive user experience for all users, regardless of ability.

## System Overview

The accessibility architecture is a cross-cutting concern that integrates with all UI components and interactions to provide:

- **Semantic HTML Structure**: Proper heading hierarchy, landmark regions, and descriptive markup
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with logical tab order and visible focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels, descriptions, and live regions for dynamic content
- **Visual Accessibility**: High contrast ratios, scalable fonts, and motion preferences
- **Input Accessibility**: Alternative input methods and assistive technology compatibility

## Core Components

### 1. Semantic Structure Foundation
```mermaid

    B --> C[Heading Hierarchy]
    C --> D[Focus Management]
    D --> E[Screen Reader Announcements]
```

### 2. Accessibility Integration Points

The accessibility architecture integrates with:

- **Visual Design System**: Ensures color contrast and visual hierarchy compliance
- **Responsive UI System**: Maintains accessibility across all device sizes and orientations
- **Core Application**: Provides accessibility utilities and validation tools
- **Console Logger**: Reports accessibility violations and warnings during development

### 3. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Semantic HTML structure in main page layout
- Basic ARIA landmarks and labels
- Keyboard navigation framework
- Console logging for accessibility debugging

#### Phase 2: Component Integration
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- Focus management for modal interactions
- High contrast theme support
- Screen reader testing and optimization

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Assistive technology API integration
- Voice control compatibility
- Motion and animation preference handling
- Automated accessibility testing

## Technical Architecture

### Technical Architecture

The architecture provides JavaScript utilities for:
- Dynamic ARIA attribute management
- Focus trap implementation for modals
- Keyboard event handling and routing
- Screen reader announcement queuing

### CSS Accessibility Features
Stylesheet implementations include:
- High contrast color schemes
- Focus indicator styling
- Reduced motion media queries
- Screen reader-only content helpers

### Testing and Validation
- Console-based accessibility violation reporting
- Keyboard navigation testing utilities
- Screen reader compatibility verification
- Color contrast validation tools

## Integration with Other Systems

This accessibility architecture works in conjunction with:

- **[[ui-visual-design-architecture]]**: Ensures visual accessibility standards
- **[[responsive-ui-architecture]]**: Maintains accessibility across device contexts
- **[[app-core-module]]**: Provides core accessibility infrastructure
- **[[stage-module]]**: Ensures interactive elements are accessible

The architecture fulfills the comprehensive accessibility requirements defined in `[[../../Definition/Requirements/accessibility-requirement]]` and integrates seamlessly with the overall Sprunki architecture defined in `[[sprunki-core-architecture]]`.
