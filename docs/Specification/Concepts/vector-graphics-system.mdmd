title: "Vector Graphics System"
composition-type: "software-subsystem-definition"
status: "draft"
version: "0.2"
brief: "Subsystem for vector graphics manipulation, likely using Fabric.js."
see-also:
  - "[[character-editor-module]]"
  - "[[core-system-requirements]]"
  - "[[../../Definition/Requirements/client-side-architecture-requirement.mdmd]]"

The Vector Graphics System, primarily utilized by the `[[character-editor-module]]` and contributing to the `[[../../Definition/Requirements/CoreSystemRequirements.mdmd]]`, provides functionalities for vector-based character creation. It operates entirely client-side per `[[../../Definition/Requirements/client-side-architecture-requirement.mdmd]]`.

This system provides:

- **Shape Creation**: Drawing paths, polygons, circles, etc. via `[[../Implementations/character/drawing-canvas-class.mdmd]]`
- **Object Manipulation**: Moving, scaling, rotating, grouping vector objects with `[[../Implementations/utils/vector2d-utils.mdmd]]`
- **Styling**: Applying fills, strokes, gradients, and effects using `[[../Implementations/utils/color-utils.mdmd]]`
- **Texture Management**: Handling images and textures `[[../Implementations/character/texture-manager-class.mdmd]]`
- **Serialization**: Saving and loading vector scenes (e.g., to/from SVG or custom JSON)

This will be heavily reliant on the chosen library (Fabric.js) and exposed via components like `[[../Implementations/character/drawing-canvas-class.mdmd]]`.
