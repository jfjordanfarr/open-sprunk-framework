The Character Editor module is a primary creative hub, allowing users to design and customize characters. This directly supports a core aspect of `[[../../Definition/Requirements/CoreSystemRequirements.mdmd]]`. It must function entirely client-side as per `[[../../Definition/Requirements/client-side-architecture-requirement.mdmd]]`. All significant user actions within this editor should be covered by `[[../../Definition/Requirements/undo-redo-requirement.mdmd]]`. The character data created is integral to project persistence (`[[../../Definition/Requirements/project-saving-requirement.mdmd]]`, `[[../../Definition/Requirements/project-autosave-requirement.mdmd]]`) and the final `[[../../Definition/Requirements/html5-export-requirement.mdmd]]`.

The Character Editor module allows users to:

- **Draw & Edit Shapes**: Using a Fabric.js based canvas `[[../Implementations/character/drawing-canvas-class.mdmd]]`
- **Manage Textures**: Apply and manage textures/images `[[../Implementations/character/texture-manager-class.mdmd]]`
- **Define Body Parts**: Structure character as a hierarchy of editable parts
- **Save/Load Characters**: Persist character designs `[[../Implementations/character/character-data-schema.mdmd]]`
