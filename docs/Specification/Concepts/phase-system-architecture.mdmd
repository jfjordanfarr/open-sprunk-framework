## Overview

The Phase System Architecture defines how multi-modal character phases (appearance + music + animation combinations) are structured, managed, and coordinated throughout the Open Sprunk Framework. This system serves as the creative foundation enabling rich, dynamic musical performances.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Phase-Centric Design
All major systems (character, animation, music, stage) operate with phase-awareness as a primary design constraint. No system operates in isolation from the phase context.

### 2. Tri-Modal Integration
Every phase integrates three modalities seamlessly:
- **Visual**: Appearance, textures, visual effects
- **Audio**: Music loops, samples, audio effects  
- **Kinetic**: Animation patterns, movement behaviors

### 3. Flexible Coordination
Phase changes can be coordinated across multiple entities (characters, backgrounds) or operate independently, based on creative requirements.

### 4. Non-Destructive Authoring
Phase creation and modification preserves existing work, enabling iterative refinement without data loss.

## Core Components

### Phase Manager [[phase-manager-class]]
Central orchestrator for all phase operations:
- Phase creation, modification, deletion
- Phase validation and integrity checking
- Phase metadata management
- Cross-system phase synchronization

### Phase Data Store [[phase-data-store-class]]
Persistent storage and retrieval for phase information:
- Multi-modal phase data organization
- Phase versioning and history
- Efficient phase data serialization
- Cross-reference integrity maintenance

### Phase Transition Engine [[phase-transition-engine-class]]
Handles transitions between phases:
- Transition timing and synchronization
- Visual and audio crossfading
- Beat-aligned phase switching
- Custom transition animations

### Phase Coordinator [[phase-coordinator-class]]
Manages phase relationships across multiple entities:
- Character-to-character phase coordination
- Background-to-character phase synchronization
- Global phase change orchestration
- Conditional phase change logic

## Editor Integration

### Character Editor Enhancement
- **Phase Selection Interface**: UI for choosing which phase to edit
- **Phase Creation Workflow**: Tools for creating new character phases
- **Phase Preview System**: Visual comparison between character phases
- **Appearance Variation Tools**: Efficient tools for creating visual variants

### Animation Editor Enhancement  
- **Phase-Aware Timeline**: Animation timeline shows phase context
- **Phase Animation Linking**: Tools for associating animations with specific phases
- **Cross-Phase Animation Tools**: Utilities for creating transition animations
- **Phase Animation Templates**: Predefined animation patterns for rapid authoring

### Music Editor Enhancement
- **Phase Loop Association**: Tools for linking music loops to character phases
- **Phase Audio Coordination**: Management of audio relationships between character phases
- **Phase Music Templates**: Predefined musical patterns for different phase types
- **Beat-Aligned Phase Triggers**: Music-driven phase change configuration

### Background Editor Integration
- **Background Phase Creation**: Tools for creating coordinated background phases
- **Character-Background Synchronization**: Configuration of background responses to character phases
- **Environmental Phase Effects**: Background elements that enhance phase transitions

## Runtime Coordination

### Performance Stage Integration
The performance stage coordinates phase changes across all active elements:

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant PS as Performance Stage
    participant PM as Phase Manager
    participant PC as Phase Coordinator
    participant CR as Character Renderer
    participant AR as Audio Renderer
    
    User->>PS: Trigger Phase Change
    PS->>PM: Request Phase Transition
    PM->>PC: Coordinate Multi-Character Change
    PC->>CR: Update Character Visuals
    PC->>AR: Update Audio Loops
    CR->>PS: Visual Update Complete
    AR->>PS: Audio Update Complete
    PS->>User: Phase Change Complete
```

### Phase Coordination Modes

1. **Independent Mode**: Each character manages phases independently
2. **Synchronized Mode**: All characters change phases together
3. **Leader-Follower Mode**: Designated character drives phase changes for others
4. **Conditional Mode**: Phase changes based on complex state conditions

## Data Schema Integration

### Enhanced Character Schema [[enhanced-character-schema]]
```javascript
{
  characterId: "character-001",
  phases: {
    "phase-default": {
      phaseId: "phase-default",
      name: "Default",
      appearance: { /* visual data */ },
      musicLoop: { /* audio data */ },
      animations: ["anim-001", "anim-002"]
    },
    "phase-excited": {
      phaseId: "phase-excited", 
      name: "Excited",
      appearance: { /* alternate visual data */ },
      musicLoop: { /* energetic audio data */ },
      animations: ["anim-003", "anim-004"]
    }
  },
  currentPhase: "phase-default",
  phaseTransitions: { /* transition configurations */ }
}
```

### Phase-Aware Animation Schema [[phase-aware-animation-schema]]
```javascript
{
  animationId: "anim-001",
  targetPhase: "phase-default",
  phaseSpecific: true,
  keyframes: [ /* animation data */ ],
  transitionIn: { /* how this animation starts during phase change */ },
  transitionOut: { /* how this animation ends during phase change */ }
}
```
