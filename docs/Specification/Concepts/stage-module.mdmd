The Stage module is where users can view the final performance, combining all their creative assets. This fulfills a key aspect of `[[../../Definition/Requirements/CoreSystemRequirements.mdmd]]` by providing the performance/viewing experience. It operates client-side per `[[../../Definition/Requirements/client-side-architecture-requirement.mdmd]]` and produces content for `[[../../Definition/Requirements/html5-export-requirement.mdmd]]`.

Users can:

- **View Performances**: See characters animate and hear music play `[[../Implementations/stage/performance-stage-class.mdmd]]`
- **Render Characters**: Uses PixiJS for efficient rendering `[[../Implementations/stage/character-renderer-class.mdmd]]`
- **Customize Backgrounds**: Change stage appearance `[[../Implementations/stage/background-manager-class.mdmd]]`
- **Combine Creations**: Bring together characters, music, and animations
