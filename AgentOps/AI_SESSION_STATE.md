# AI Session State - Open Sprunk Framework

## Session State: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}

## Session State: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}

### 1. Current Objective / Overall Goal:
Fix style application bugs and critical rendering/visibility issues in `DrawingWindow.js`. Ensure brush styles apply correctly, Fabric.js event listeners function as expected, and drawings/parts are visible and persistent.

### 2. Current Task Focus:
Diagnose and fix the `ReferenceError: path is not defined` in `DrawingWindow.js` which is causing erratic drawing behavior and preventing style application to new paths.

### 3. Key Information & Discoveries from Last Session (Relevant to Current Issue):
- Previous attempts to fix `DrawingWindow.js` involved refactoring `handleStyleApplication`, `updateCanvasMode`, shape drawing listener management, and the `path:created` Fabric.js event listener.
- The `path:created` listener was modified to apply current brush styles (stroke, width, opacity) and a debug 'lime' fill to new paths.

### 4. Current Blockers & Bugs Being Addressed:
- **CRITICAL: `Uncaught ReferenceError: path is not defined at DrawingWindow.onPathCreated (DrawingWindow.js:807:47)`**.
    - This error is thrown when a path is created (e.g., on mouse up after drawing).
    - **Consequences:**
        - No 'lime' fill or intended brush styles are applied to new paths.
        - Highly erratic drawing behavior: drawing occurs on any mouse hover; clicking/releasing clears the drawing, only for new drawing to immediately follow the mouse.
        - Color changes are problematic and only respected after mouse release.
- **Persistent Core Visibility Issues (Potentially Masked by Current Error):**
    - Drawings disappearing after mouse release (now manifesting as the click/release clearing behavior).
    - Default character parts are invisible.
- **CSS Inclusion (Ongoing User Task):** Verification that `drawing-window.css` is correctly linked in the main HTML is still pending and crucial for overall visibility.

### 5. Hypothesis for Current Critical Error:
- The `ReferenceError` in `onPathCreated` (or the function/method handling the `path:created` event at line 807) halts its execution. This prevents styles from being applied and likely leaves Fabric.js in an unstable state regarding its drawing mode and event handling, leading to the observed erratic behavior.
- The error suggests that the code at line 807 is trying to use a variable `path` directly, instead of accessing it from the event object (e.g., `event.path`).

### 6. Immediate Next Steps:
1.  **Update AI_SESSION_STATE.md (Done in this step)**: Reflect the new critical error and its consequences.
2.  **Inspect `DrawingWindow.js` at/near Line 807 (PENDING)**: Use `view_line_range` to see the exact code causing the `ReferenceError`. Determine if `onPathCreated` is a class method that's incorrectly defined/called, or if the anonymous arrow function set up as the listener in `setupComponentEventListeners` has a flaw or was not the version that got effectively applied/is running.
3.  **Correct `onPathCreated` Handler (PENDING)**: Based on the inspection, modify the code to correctly access the path object from the Fabric.js event argument (e.g., change `path.property` to `e.path.property`).
4.  **Re-Test Drawing Functionality (PENDING)**: After applying the fix:
    *   Verify the `ReferenceError` is gone.
    *   Check if the 'lime' fill appears on new paths.
    *   Confirm correct application of brush stroke color, width, and opacity.
    *   Ensure the erratic hover-drawing and click-clearing behaviors are resolved.
5.  **Address Minor Cleanup (Lower Priority - Post-Critical Fix)**: Remove the duplicated `this.currentBrushOpacity = 1;` line from the `DrawingWindow` constructor.

### 6.11. Fixing `onPathCreated` - Progress & Next Attempt ({{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}):
- **Primary Focus**: Fully resolve the `ReferenceError: path is not defined` in the `onPathCreated(e)` method in `DrawingWindow.js`.
- **Previous Attempt Results**:
    - **SUCCESS**: The line `this.recordAction('path-created', { path: path.toObject() });` was correctly changed to `this.recordAction('path-created', { path: e.path.toObject() });`.
    - **FAILURE**: The attempt to change `path.dirty = true;` to `e.path.dirty = true;` failed because the tool reported `target content was not unique`.
- **Current State of `onPathCreated(e)` (relevant part after first fix)**:
  ```javascript
  // ...
  e.path.visible = true;
  this.recordAction('path-created', { path: e.path.toObject() }); 
  
  if (this.fabricCanvas) {
    path.dirty = true; // This line still needs to be e.path.dirty
    this.fabricCanvas.requestRenderAll();
  // ...
  }
  ```
- **Action Plan**:
    1.  **Correct Remaining Error in `onPathCreated` (Immediate)**: Use `replace_file_content` with a more specific `TargetContent` to change `path.dirty = true;` to `e.path.dirty = true;` within the `if (this.fabricCanvas)` block.
    2.  **Re-Test Drawing**: After the fix is fully applied, test drawing functionality again, looking for:
        *   Absence of the `ReferenceError`.
        *   Appearance of 'lime' fill on new paths.
        *   Correct application of brush stroke, width, and opacity.
        *   Resolution of hover-drawing and click-clearing issues.
    3.  **CSS Inclusion Check (USER TASK - Ongoing Reminder)**: User to **verify `drawing-window.css` is correctly linked**.
    4.  **Address Minor Cleanups (Lower Priority)**: Clean up duplicated `currentBrushOpacity` in constructor once critical drawing functionality is restored.
    5.  **Investigate `StylePaletteManager` (Lower Priority)**: Address the 'Fill Color' UI issue if necessary.

### 6.12. Post `ReferenceError` Fix - New Focus: Rendering & Visibility Issues ({{2025-06-05 15:11:03}}):
- **`ReferenceError` in `onPathCreated` (class method) is RESOLVED.**
- **Erratic drawing behavior (hover-drawing, click-clearing with immediate redraw) is RESOLVED.** Drawing mechanics are now correct.
- **NEW PRIMARY ISSUES & OBSERVATIONS:**
    1.  **Paths Disappear on Mouse Release:** Drawn paths are logged as created and added to `fabricCanvas.getObjects()`, but they are not persistently visible on the canvas after the mouse is released.
    2.  **Styles Not Rendering Visibly:** 
        *   The debug 'lime' fill set in the anonymous `path:created` listener is NOT visible.
        *   Stroke width and opacity changes (from style palette) are logged as updating internal state and the Fabric brush, but these changes are NOT visible on drawn paths.
        *   Only brush color changes are visibly respected on new strokes.
    3.  **Primitives (Circles, Squares) Still Invisible:** Default character parts do not render.
- **Log Analysis:**
    *   Both `onPathCreated` (class method) and the anonymous `path:created` listener (in `setupComponentEventListeners`) fire for each path.
    *   The anonymous listener successfully sets properties like `fill: 'lime'`, `stroke`, `strokeWidth`, `opacity` on the Fabric path object in memory (confirmed by `console.log(e.path)` showing these properties).
    *   `fabricCanvas.getObjects().length` correctly increments.
- **Current Leading Hypotheses:**
    1.  **CSS Issues (Strongly Suspected):** Rules in `drawing-window.css` (or other global CSS) might be hiding Fabric objects (`path`, `circle`, etc.) or the canvas itself (e.g., via `opacity: 0`, `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`).
    2.  **Canvas Clearing/Reset:** An unknown mechanism might be clearing or resetting the canvas or its layers after paths are drawn.
- **Action Plan & Next Steps:**
    1.  **Drawing Functionality Test (Post `path:created` Refinement - {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}):**
        *   **Lime Fill:** NOT visible on drawn paths.
        *   **Stroke Width:** IS respected on drawn paths (Progress!).
        *   **Path Persistence:** Drawn paths still disappear after mouse release.
        *   **Console Logs from `path:created` anonymous listener:** Confirmed that `e.path.set({...})` is applying `fill: 'lime'`, correct stroke, width, opacity, `visible: true`, and `objectCaching: false` to the path object in memory.
    2.  **CSS Investigation - CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH ({{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}):**
        *   User commented out the **ENTIRE content** of `drawing-window.css`.
        *   **RESULTS (with CSS disabled):**
            *   **Primitives (head, body, hands): VISIBLE and interactive!**
            *   **Drawn Paths: PERSIST after mouse release!**
            *   **Lime Fill (on paths): VISIBLE!**
            *   **Stroke Color & Width (on paths): Respected!**
            *   **Fill Color (from palette on paths):** No visible change (expected, due to hardcoded lime fill for debug).
            *   **UI Layout:** Controls overflow vertically (expected, due to lack of layout CSS).
        *   **CONCLUSION: CSS rules within `drawing-window.css` were definitively the root cause for both primitive and drawn path visibility, persistence, and style rendering issues.**
    3.  **CSS Isolation - General Styles Test (Lines 1-425 of `drawing-window.css`):**
        *   **Action:** User uncommented lines 1-425 (general styles, outside `@media` blocks). All `@media` blocks remained commented out.
        *   **Action (User Test - 2025-06-05 15:59:47):** User temporarily removed all `@media` queries from `drawing-window.css`, leaving only general (non-responsive) styles active. Tested drawing functionality. (Change was then reverted via CTRL+Z).
        *   **RESULTS (Only General Styles Active):**
            *   **Primitives (head, body, hands): INVISIBLE.**
            *   **Drawn Paths: INVISIBLE / NON-PERSISTENT (disappeared).**
            *   **UI Layout:** (Assumed generally functional as focus was on drawing visibility).
        *   **CONCLUSION: The problematic CSS rule(s) causing invisibility ARE LOCATED within the general (non-responsive) styles of `drawing-window.css`.** The `@media` query blocks are not the primary cause of this specific invisibility issue.

    4.  **Next Diagnostic Step - Pinpoint Problematic CSS within Lines 1-425:**
        *   **Strategy 1 (Targeted Isolation):**
            *   Examine lines 1-425 for rules styling:
                *   `.canvas-container`
                *   `.drawing-canvas-section`
                *   `canvas` (generic tag)
                *   Immediate canvas wrappers
                *   `.canvas-overlay`
            *   Comment out entire blocks for these selectors one by one and test.
        *   **Strategy 2 (Systematic Division - if targeted is unclear):**
            *   Divide lines 1-425 into smaller blocks (e.g., 1-100, 101-200).
            *   Comment out one block at a time and test visibility.
            *   Narrow down the problematic section iteratively.

### 7. Longer-Term / Related Issues (To Revisit After Critical Fix):
- Verify `drawing-window.css` inclusion.
- Investigate `StylePaletteManager` UI for fill color if issues persist.
- Full testing of all tool functionalities, selection, and styling once basic drawing is stable.
*   **Stroke Color (Properties Panel):** This specific interaction was not explicitly captured in the provided logs. Needs testing after the fix.
*   **Core Visibility Issues Unchanged:** Drawings still disappear, and default primitives are invisible, despite objects being added to the canvas collection with expected (logged) initial properties.

**Revised Next Steps & Hypotheses (Continued):**
1.  **Refactor `DrawingWindow.js -> handleStyleApplication` (TOP PRIORITY for styles):**
    *   Restructure the method to prioritize styling the brush (strokeWidth, stroke color from properties panel) if the current tool is 'pen' or 'brush', irrespective of `this.selectedPart` or `eventPayload.object`.
    *   Separately, handle applying styles to a selected Fabric object if one is active and matches `this.selectedPart`.
    *   Update `this.currentDrawingColor` if the brush's stroke color is changed via the properties panel to maintain consistency with `updateCanvasMode`.
2.  **Test Stroke Color from Properties Panel:** After refactoring `handleStyleApplication`, specifically test if changing the stroke color via the properties panel affects the brush color.
3.  **Re-investigate `onPathCreated` / Disappearing Paths & Invisible Primitives:** These remain critical and likely point to a rendering lifecycle issue, an unexpected canvas clear, or a CSS/DOM obscuring problem.

**USER Objective:**
Fix DrawingWindow and StylePaletteManager Bugs

Resolve hex color format warnings in StylePaletteManager, eliminate duplicate event listener registration in DrawingWindow.js, enable drawing tools functionality, and investigate the blank main stage character rendering issue.

**Current Task & Focus:**
- **Debugging `DrawingWindow.js`: Duplicate Event Listener Registration.**
  - The primary goal is to identify why `setupComponentEventListeners()` is being called multiple times and ensure it's invoked only once.

**Progress & Accomplishments (from previous session/checkpoint):**
- Modified `StylePaletteManager.updatePropertyControls` to ensure 6-digit hex color codes.
- Linked `drawing-window-class.mdmd` to `event-bus-class.mdmd`.
- Modified `CharacterRenderer.render` method to accept and pass `stageTransform`.
- Fixed Fabric.js `setPositionByOrigin` error in `DrawingWindow.handleCanvasAction`.
- Removed erroneous `this.eventBus = null;` in `DrawingWindow` constructor.
- Updated event listener registration in `DrawingWindow.js` to use `this.eventBus.on(...)`.
- Removed duplicate instantiation of `PartLibraryManager` in `DrawingWindow.initializeComponents()`.
- Added missing `data-category` divs in `DrawingWindow.js` layout.

**Observed Issues & Blockers (Prioritized):**
1.  **Duplicate Event Listener Registration in `DrawingWindow.js` (TOP PRIORITY):** `DrawingWindow.setupComponentEventListeners` is being called more than once.
2.  **DrawingWindow Drawing Tools Not Functional (High Priority):** Likely impacted by the event listener issue.
3.  **Main Stage Blank (Medium Priority - Test Pending):** `CharacterRenderer` fix needs verification.
4.  **Timeline Error (Low Priority):** Error in `TimelineCanvasRenderer.js`.
            2.  In `setupComponentEventListeners()`, changed all `document.addEventListener` calls to `this.eventBus.on()`, adjusting the callback to expect data directly (e.g., `(partData)` instead of `(event) => event.detail`). This should enable `DrawingWindow` to correctly receive events from its sub-managers.
        *   **User Query:** Is the dependency of `DrawingWindow.js` on `EventBus.js` documented in `drawing-window-class.mdmd`?
        *   **MDMD Audit Findings (`drawing-window-class.mdmd`):**
            *   The file *mentions* `this.eventBus = null;` in its embedded JavaScript skeleton, acknowledging an event bus.
            *   However, it **does not** explicitly link to the `EventBus` MDMD unit (e.g., `[[event-bus-class]]`) in its `see-also` section or prose, which is a deviation from the project's MDMD guidelines.
        *   **MDMD Audit Findings (`drawing-window-class.mdmd`):**
            *   The file *mentions* `this.eventBus = null;` in its embedded JavaScript skeleton, acknowledging an event bus.
            *   However, it **does not** explicitly link to the `EventBus` MDMD unit (e.g., `[[event-bus-class]]`) in its `see-also` section or prose, which is a deviation from the project's MDMD guidelines.
        *   **`EventBus.js` MDMD Unit Located:**
            *   Found `docs/Specification/Implementations/core/event-bus-class.mdmd`. The ID is assumed to be `event-bus-class`.
        *   **MDMD Audit Action Taken (`drawing-window-class.mdmd`):**
            1.  Added `[[event-bus-class]]` to its `see-also` list.
            2.  Added prose clarifying its use of the `EventBus` (via `[[event-bus-class]]`) for internal component communication.

*   **USER FEEDBACK & NEW CRITICAL ERROR:**
    *   Application shows "Application Error" and is not interactable.
    *   **New Next Step:** Obtained full file tree via `tree_gitignore.py`. The tree shows `src/index.html` and `src/main.js`.
    *   **Updated Strategy:** `src/main.js` is the main application script.
    *   **Current Action:** Viewed `src/main.js`. It defines `SpunkiApp` which instantiates `DrawingWindow` once in its `createCharacterEditor` method, called during `SpunkiApp.init()`. The `DrawingWindow` constructor calls its internal `init()`, which calls `setupComponentEventListeners()`. This flow appears correct for a single registration.
    *   **Revised Hypothesis:** The duplicate listener registration is not due to multiple `DrawingWindow` instantiations or direct multiple calls to `setupComponentEventListeners` in `main.js` or `DrawingWindow.js`'s typical init flow. Re-examination of `DrawingWindow.js` confirms its internal initialization is linear and should only register listeners once.
    *   **New Leading Hypothesis:** Lingering code related to the old `src/character/CharacterEditor.js` (which still exists and is substantial, as confirmed by `grep_search`) might be causing interference. While `main.js` uses the method name `createCharacterEditor`, it correctly instantiates `DrawingWindow`.
    *   **Key Finding & Root Cause Identified:** `grep_search` revealed that `DrawingWindow.init()` was called twice: 
        1. Internally by the `DrawingWindow` constructor (`src/character/DrawingWindow.js`).
        2. Externally by `SpunkiApp.createCharacterEditor()` in `src/main.js` *after* the `DrawingWindow` instance was created and its constructor had already run.
    *   **Conclusion:** This double call to `init()` caused `setupComponentEventListeners()` to be executed twice, leading to duplicate event listeners.
    *   **Fix Applied:** Edited `src/main.js` to comment out the redundant `await characterEditor.init();` call in `SpunkiApp.createCharacterEditor()`. The `DrawingWindow` constructor is now solely responsible for its initialization.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The duplicate event listener issue in `DrawingWindow` should be resolved.
    *   **Current Status:** User tested. Duplicate event listeners FIXED. Drawing functionality still broken: default parts don't appear. Diagnostic logs (`this.fabricCanvas.getObjects()`) CONFIRM that Fabric objects (head, body, hands) ARE being created and ADDED to the canvas collection. The issue is therefore that they are not VISIBLE. Planning to add further diagnostic code to `createDefaultPartGeometry` to force extremely obvious styles (bright red fill, thick yellow stroke) on a test part (e.g., head) after it's added, to rule out styling/opacity issues. User has agreed to delete the old `src/character/CharacterEditor.js` file.
*   **Next Steps After This:**
    *   Test the integrated `DrawingWindow` (including the 'center' canvas action and general UI functionality).
    *   Address the `TimelineCanvasRenderer.js` error when appropriate.
*   **Next Steps After This:**
    *   Verify `CharacterEditor.js` is fully decoupled.
    *   Test the integrated `DrawingWindow` (including the 'center' canvas action).
    *   Address the `TimelineCanvasRenderer.js` error when appropriate.
*   **Next Steps After This:**
    *   Investigate and fix the Fabric.js `setPositionByOrigin` error in `DrawingWindow.js`.
    *   Verify `CharacterEditor.js` is fully decoupled (no imports, no registrations).
    *   Test the integrated `DrawingWindow` functionality thoroughly.
    *   Address the `TimelineCanvasRenderer.js` error when appropriate.
3.  **Robustness Pass & Refinement (COMPLETED):**
    - Review `AudioEngine.js` audio resume logic (Verdict: Sufficiently robust).
    - Review `EventBus.js` event logging suppression (Verdict: Current magic string `'stage:mouse_move'` is not robust. ~~Plan: Refactor to use a configurable list of suppressed events~~).
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: `EventBus.js` class definition refactored to support configurable suppressed events.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated `EventBus` instantiation in `AppCore.js` with new configuration.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated `EventBus` instantiation in `src/character/CharacterAuthoringIntegration.js` with new configuration (consistent with `AppCore.js`).

**PROGRESS UPDATE**:
✅ Timeline initialization is now WORKING! All components initialized successfully
✅ Stage monitoring error FIXED! Both currentTime and fps properties now safely handled

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**:
- PerformanceStage.getPerformanceMetrics() was delegating to PerformanceMetrics.getPerformanceMetrics()
- PerformanceMetrics.getPerformanceMetrics() didn't include `currentTime` property
- main.js was trying to access `metrics.currentTime.toFixed(2)` on undefined value

**FIXES APPLIED**:
1. ✅ **PerformanceStage.js**: Updated getPerformanceMetrics() to always include currentTime and isPlaying
2. ✅ **main.js**: Added safety checks with fallback values for currentTime and fps properties

**COMPLETED ACTIONS**:
1. ✅ Timeline initialization: BeatMarkerGenerator, TrackManager, TemporalCoordinator all working
2. ✅ Stage monitoring: Fixed missing currentTime property in performance metrics
3. ✅ Error handling: Added fallback values to prevent undefined property access

**EXPECTED RESULT**: Application should now run smoothly without console errors. Stage monitoring should display time and FPS correctly.

**APPLICATION STATUS**: 
- ✅ Core systems: All initialized and working
- ✅ Timeline system: Fully operational 
- ✅ Stage monitoring: Fixed and should be error-free
- ✅ Mouse events: Working properly
- 🎉 **READY FOR TESTING**: Application should now run without errors

### Background Context:
✅ **COMPLETED**: Timeline initialization error fully resolved
✅ **COMPLETED**: Stage monitoring runtime error fixed
- Fixed BeatMarkerGenerator, TrackManager, and TemporalCoordinator issues
- Application now starts successfully and all components initialize

✅ **COMPLETED**: Workspace cleanup and CSS integration
- All MDMD files migrated to proper strata structure  
- CSS consolidation and integration complete
- No duplicate or obsolete files remain
- TimelineUI.js syntax error fixed

### Previous Success:
The application was successfully starting and all core components were initializing until the Timeline component failure.

### Error Stack Trace:
```
Timeline.js:70:27 → configureComponents() → this.temporalCoordinator.setTempo()
AnimationTimelineEditor.js:40:25 → initialize() → new Timeline()
main.js:142:9 → createAnimationTimelineEditor()
main.js:37:38 → SpunkiApp.init()
```

### Next Steps:
1. ⚠️ **URGENT**: Fix TemporalCoordinator.setTempo method
2. Test Timeline initialization
3. Verify full application startup

# AI Session State - Open Sprunk Framework

## Current Phase: MDMD Structure Alignment & Workspace Cleanup

### Active Task: 
✅ **FIXED**: TimelineUI.js syntax error at line 323 (extra closing brace removed)

**USER CLARIFICATION**: Project uses vanilla JavaScript (not Node.js). Continue with workspace cleanup using vanilla JS approach.

Continue with:
- Review and resolve the status of `src/character/drawing-window-demo.html` and `src/character/drawing-window.css`:
  - Determine if the demo HTML is still needed for testing or if the main app covers its use case.
  - Assess if `drawing-window.css` contains unique/critical styles or if its content should be merged into `main.css` and the file deleted.

Scan the rest of the `src/` directory for:
- Any other obsolete, backup, or duplicate files (e.g., files with `_old`, `_backup`, etc.).
- Any MDMD files accidentally placed in `src/`.

### Progress Status: SRC DIRECTORY AUDIT & CLEANUP (IN PROGRESS)

### Completed Work (MDMD):
- All legacy MDMD files from 02_COMPOSITIONS and 03_UNITS migrated or archived
- Stray composition moved to Specification/Concepts
- Legacy folders removed

### Completed Work (SRC):
- CSS consolidation: main.css kept, main-new.css and enhanced-main.css deleted
- Empty/obsolete JS file ExpressionSystemOptimized.js deleted

### Pending:
- Review/merge: drawing-window-demo.html, drawing-window.css
- Scan for other obsolete/backup files in src/

### Status:
- MDMD strata alignment complete
- SRC codebase audit and cleanup in progress

### Next Steps:
1. Analyze drawing-window-demo.html and drawing-window.css for redundancy, uniqueness, and alignment with MDMD/canonical styles.
2. Scan src/ for obsolete, backup, or misplaced files (including MDMD files in src/).
3. Prepare for final commit after cleanup.

### Current Task: Docs Directory Cleanup and Audit (REDEFINED by User)
- **Objective**: Realign MDMD file locations to the standard `docs/Definition/[Vision|Requirements]/` and `docs/Specification/[Concepts|Implementations]/` strata.
- **Action**: Update Copilot instructions, identify new/changed files, audit for duplicates or misfiled documents, move files, and prepare for a clean commit.
- **Status**: Instructions updated. Preparing to analyze workspace changes for file migration.

## MDMD Migration: Character Subdirectory (docs/03_UNITS/character/)

- Archived: drawing-window-optimized-class.mdmd → AgentOps/Archive/drawing-window-optimization-report.mdmd
- Moved: Remaining 6 MDMD files → docs/Specification/Implementations/character/
- Updated: All source-ref fields to ../../../src/character/[CorrespondingJSFile.js]
- Renamed: drawing-window-interface.mdmd → drawing-window-class.mdmd

Status: Character MDMD migration in progress. Will confirm completion and details after file operations.

Next: Address stage subdirectory as per user instruction.

## Final Cleanup Analysis

### Demo Files Status:
- **`src/character/drawing-window-demo.html`**: ✅ **KEEP** - Valuable standalone testing tool for character editor
- **`src/character/drawing-window.css`**: ⚠️ **NEEDS INTEGRATION** - Contains critical styles used by `DrawingWindow.js` component but not included in main app

### Critical Finding:
The main application (`src/index.html`) does NOT include `drawing-window.css`, but the `DrawingWindow.js` component uses CSS classes like:
- `.drawing-window`
- `.drawing-header` 
- `.drawing-main`
- `.part-library-panel`
- `.canvas-container`
- etc.

**Action Required**: Import drawing-window.css into main.css or include it in index.html.

### Additional Scan Results:
- ✅ No `_old`, `_backup`, or similar duplicate files found
- ✅ No MDMD files misplaced in `src/` directory  
- ✅ All files in src/ appear to be current and necessary

### Next Steps:
1. Import `drawing-window.css` into `src/styles/main.css` 
2. Test character mode to ensure styles load properly
3. Consider consolidating vs keeping separate CSS file

## Foundation Status
**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅**
- Core infrastructure: AppCore, EventBus, StateManager
- Stage foundation: PerformanceStage, CharacterRenderer, BackgroundManager
- Drawing system: CharacterEditor, DrawingCanvas with Fabric.js
- MDMD specification architecture: 139+ cross-references, kebab-case IDs (NEEDS AUDIT FOR STRATA ALIGNMENT)

## ✅ TASK COMPLETE: Workspace Cleanup & CSS Integration

### Final Actions Completed:
- **CSS Integration**: Added `@import url('../character/drawing-window.css');` to `src/styles/main.css` to ensure character editor styles are available in main application
- **Demo Files Reviewed**: 
  - `src/character/drawing-window-demo.html` retained as valuable testing tool
  - `src/character/drawing-window.css` integrated into main app via CSS import
- **Empty File Scan**: Confirmed no empty or orphaned files remain
- **Duplicate File Scan**: Confirmed no backup, old, or temporary files exist

### Summary of All Cleanup Actions:
1. ✅ **MDMD Migration**: All legacy MDMD files moved from `docs/02_COMPOSITIONS/` and `docs/03_UNITS/` to proper strata structure
2. ✅ **CSS Consolidation**: Removed duplicate `main-new.css` and `enhanced-main.css` files
3. ✅ **JS Cleanup**: Removed empty `ExpressionSystemOptimized.js` file  
4. ✅ **TimelineUI.js Fix**: Corrected syntax error (extra closing brace)
5. ✅ **Character MDMD**: Migrated 6 MDMD files with correct `source-ref` paths
6. ✅ **CSS Integration**: Connected drawing-window.css to main application
7. ✅ **Final Verification**: No obsolete, backup, or duplicate files remain

### Workspace Status:
**CLEAN & READY FOR COMMIT** - All files aligned with MDMD specification structure, no duplicates or obsolete files detected.

Next recommended action: Commit these cleanup changes before proceeding with new development.
