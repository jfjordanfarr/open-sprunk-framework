**LONG CONTEXT GEMINI BREAKTHROUGH: RECURSIVE BILAYER MODEL**
LCG provided comprehensive insights for MDMD evolution:
- **Recursive Strata Model**: "Bilayers all the way down" with Definition/Specification bilayers
- **Technical Standards**: Kebab-case IDs, [[id]] linking, title attributes for human readability
- **Enhanced Cross-Reference Strategy**: Semantic relationship types, minimal sufficient linking
- **MyST Integration**: YAML-in-directive-blocks, global ID scope, tooling support

**CURRENT TASK: WORKSPACE REORGANIZATION ‚Üí PRISTINE STATE FOR SOURCE DEVELOPMENT**

**KEY LCG RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPLEMENT:**
1. **Strata Organization**: Reorganize from numbered layers to semantic strata
   - `docs/00_IDEATION/` ‚Üí `docs/Definition/Vision/`
   - `docs/01_REQUIREMENTS/` ‚Üí `docs/Definition/Requirements/`
   - `docs/02_COMPOSITIONS/` ‚Üí `docs/Specification/Concepts/`
   - `docs/03_UNITS/` ‚Üí `docs/Specification/Implementations/`

2. **ID Standardization Enhancement**:
   - ‚úÖ **Kebab-Case IDs**: All 45 MDMD files already follow kebab-case standard
   - ‚úÖ **Title Attributes**: All files have human-readable titles
   - **NEW**: Enhance with cleaner title/ID separation

3. **Cross-Reference Standards**:
   - **Primary Pattern**: `[[target-id]]` for MDMD-to-MDMD references
   - **Semantic Context**: Explicit prose around links explaining relationship nature
   - **YAML Location**: Maintain YAML within directive blocks (not document-level frontmatter)

4. **MDMD Specification Evolution**:
   - **Section 3.1**: ID Conventions and Cross-Reference Standards (kebab-case requirements)
   - **Section 3.2**: MDMD Standards vs. MyST Integration guidelines
   - **Enhanced Examples**: Title attributes, improved ID format, semantic linking

- **Intuitive Animation Interface**: "Click and drag a doll to make it dance" - keyframe manipulation through direct character interaction
- **Instrument Integration**: Characters can have built-in instruments (trumpet, piano, etc.) as part of their design
- **Rich Audio-Visual Pairing**: Sophisticated animations synchronized with user's audio creations
- **Phase-Aware Design**: ALL components must support multiple phases

KEY DESIGN QUESTIONS:
- Phase data structure: How to organize appearance/audio/animation data per phase?

- Phase transitions: How do characters smoothly transition between phases during performance?
- Background phase system: How do backgrounds participate in the phase system?
- Editor UX: How to present phase-aware editing without overwhelming complexity?
