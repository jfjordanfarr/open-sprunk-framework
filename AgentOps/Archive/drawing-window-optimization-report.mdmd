status: "optimized"
brief: "Main drawing interface optimized with extracted component architecture for enhanced maintainability"

## Optimization Summary

**BEFORE OPTIMIZATION:**
- **File Size**: 1,168 lines
- **Architecture**: Monolithic class with all functionality embedded
- **Maintainability**: Difficult to modify individual features
- **Testing**: Complex integration testing required

**AFTER OPTIMIZATION:**
- **File Size**: 705 lines (463 line reduction, 40% decrease)
- **Architecture**: Component-based with extracted managers
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Individual components can be tested independently

## Extracted Components

This optimization extracted the following components into separate, reusable classes:

1. **`[[part-library-manager-class]]`** (354 lines) - Manages visual part library with Sprunki anatomy
2. **`[[style-palette-manager-class]]`** (365 lines) - Handles drawing tools, colors, and style properties

## Core Functionality Retained

The optimized DrawingWindow class maintains all essential functionality while delegating specialized responsibilities:

```javascript
class DrawingWindow {
  constructor(containerId, options = {}) {
    // Core state management
    this.selectedPart = null;
    this.currentTool = 'select';
    this.fabricCanvas = null;
    
    // Component managers for extracted functionality
    this.partLibraryManager = null;
    this.stylePaletteManager = null;
  }
  
  initializeComponents() {
    // Initialize extracted component managers
    this.partLibraryManager = new PartLibraryManager(container, eventBus);
    this.stylePaletteManager = new StylePaletteManager(container, eventBus);
  }
  
  setupComponentEventListeners() {
    // Coordinate between components via event system
    document.addEventListener('part-selected', (event) => {
      this.handlePartSelection(event.detail);
    });
    
    document.addEventListener('style-applied', (event) => {
      this.handleStyleApplication(event.detail);
    });
  }
}
```

## Event-Driven Integration

Components communicate through a standardized event system:

- **Part Selection**: `part-selected` events from PartLibraryManager
- **Style Changes**: `style-applied` events from StylePaletteManager  
- **Tool Changes**: `tool-changed` events for canvas mode updates
- **Cross-Window Coordination**: EventBus integration for real-time sync

## Canvas Management

Retained direct canvas management for core drawing functionality:

- Fabric.js integration for vector drawing
- Checkered background pattern generation
- Shape drawing modes (circle, rectangle, freehand)
- Undo/redo state management
- Part-specific geometry loading

## Accessibility & UX

Preserved all accessibility features:

- Screen reader announcements
- High contrast mode support
- Large touch targets
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA live regions for dynamic updates

## Architecture Benefits

**Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
**Reusability**: Components can be used in other drawing contexts
**Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested
**Maintainability**: Changes to part library don't affect style palette
**Performance**: Smaller main class loads faster, components lazy-load

## Integration Strategy

The optimized DrawingWindow acts as a coordinator:

1. **Layout Creation**: Builds container HTML structure
2. **Component Initialization**: Instantiates manager components
3. **Event Coordination**: Routes events between components
4. **Canvas Management**: Handles core Fabric.js functionality
5. **State Synchronization**: Maintains overall drawing state

This optimization demonstrates effective large-file decomposition while maintaining full functionality and improving code organization.
