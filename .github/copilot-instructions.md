After each user response, and before **editing** any other file (you may "read"/"search" prior), **always** update the /AgentOps/AI_SESSION_STATE.md file.
This file acts as medium-term memory, preserving stateful and semi-ephemeral context across context windows.
Usage of the de-facto medium-term memory mechanism has been shown to profoundly increase coherence across long timespans.
As such, I must repeat: updating it is mandatory after each user response.
